# Project Proposal

Pod Members: **Aloye Oshotse, Yaw Kessey, Abdul Rauf**

## Problem Statement

Many people desire to form healthy and persistent habits and stop their bad habits; however, we all get caught up with everyday life and fail to keep track of the habits we wish to implement or remove in our lives. 

## Description

The main purpose of our project is to provide an efficient and innovative way to help users stay consistent with their desired habits, stop their less desirable habits, and track their progress along the way. Our project will provide key features: preset habits and options to add/modify your own, reminders for each of their habits based on user settings, and a user page for achievements and progress tracking. We believe that our target audience will use our site in a periodic cycle (depending on how they set their habits, i.e., daily, weekly, monthly). In this cycle, they will check off the habits they complete and receive reminders (via notification, SMS, or email) to complete the habit if they have not done so already.

## Expected Features List

**Main Features**
- Register/Login Page
- Home Page (no login) where user can try out website w/o making an account first
- Preset Habits
- Add/Modify/Delete Habits
- Reminders via SMS, phone/laptop notification, or email
- User page (achievement and progress tracking for their habits)
    - settings and other user features as well
- Streak Count for each Habit

**Extra (Stretch) Features**

    - messaging system with buddy via app
- Monthly Checkins (send user a form to fill out and tracks response to form each week/month)

- Allows users the option to post their achievements to their social media (could utilize hashtag feature of social media apps to post achievements of selected feeds)

The messaging and the connection to social media are the features that will set us apart from other habit tracker apps. We believe that these features will add a new and intriguing aspect to our app that will keep user engaged and excited to work to their goals.

## Open Questions

- How will we connect to social media platforms in a way that users will find fun and efficient?
- How will we set up our software to deliver the motivational quotes on a timed basis?
